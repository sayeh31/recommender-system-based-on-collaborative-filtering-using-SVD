# recommender-system-based-on-collaborative-filtering-using-SVD
In recent years, recommendation systems have played a major role in many online applications and e-commercial services. Recommending products such as movies, music,and books, many big companies, for example, Amazon, eBay, and Movielens have used recommendation systems. They have adopted recommendation techniques to predict customerâ€™s behavior and recommend products or related items. Moreover, recommendation performances have a huge impact on the commercial success of these companies in terms of revenue and user satisfaction.
There are three types of recommendation systems generally: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering (CBF) and hybrid method. Our first step uses the K-means algorithm to cluster the ratings of movies based on the user ratings. Meanwhile, we perform SVD on each cluster. For item-based recommendation, we also follow the same process for the items. Using a weighted approach, we finally combine the user-based and the item-based predictions into one.
